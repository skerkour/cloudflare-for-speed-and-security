What if I told you that you could shrink your cloud bills all while increasing the performance, scalability and security of your web applications and services?

Sounds too good to be true?

Almost unnoticed a few years ago, Cloudflare is now the fastest growing cloud platform. Best known for its Content Delivery Network (CDN) and Web Application Firewall (WAF), Cloudflare has become the easiest to use all-in-one developer platform with services ranging from object storage (R2) to serverless hosting (Workers), passing by video streaming, all while being cheaper and more reliable than the big 3 incumbents of the cloud landscape.

Their secret sauce is that hey care about developer experience and their products are secure by design. No more bucket with sensitive data publicly left exposed. No more database left wide open. No more ultra-complex security policies that lead to mistakes and leaks. No more dashboard more complex than a nuclear plant. No more surprise bill because someone targeted a `while true; do curl ...` at your servers and made your bandwidth balloon.


But, Cloudflare is not magic, you will need to learn new design patterns and have a deep understanding of protocols to get the most out of the global coud platform.


From theory to practice, you will learn how low-level network and security protocols work. How to configure Cloudflare to secure and scale your web applications. How to create serverless applications and which database to chose with serverless functions. How to optimize your caching policies. How to distribute videos globally. And a lot of other things, all of that while significantly reducing your cloud bill.




Maybe I should not tell you that, but I will literally explain you how to fire your devops team. With Cloudflare you will never ever have to manage servers, clusters or SSH keys again.


The ebooks are DRM free, of course :)


## Early Access

Between writing, editing and technical review, it can take some time to complete a book. This is why I release my books before they are completed. First, so that you can start learning today, but also, so I can get feedback and refine the content of the book with your feedback.


## Bonuses

If you purchase Cloudflare for Speed and Security **before November 4, 2023**, you will get my best seller <a href="https://kerkour.com/black-hat-rust" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Hat Rust</a> **for free**! Yes, you read it right, two books for less than the price of one!

Also, all early-access supporters will get the checklist that I use to quickly setup a new domain on Cloudflare with the right balance between security, performance, and user experience.

Finally, the price is likely to increase once the book is out of Early Access, so don't wait until it's too late to get your copy.


**Date of final publication**: mid-January 2024

## Who this book is for

This is NOT a 1000th tutorial on how to set up a CDN, nor will it teach you the fundamentals of programming.

Instead, it's a from-theory-to-practice guide and you may enjoy it if any of the following:

- You think that speed is a fundamental part of the user experience
- You keep screaming "show me the code!" when reading about scaling
- You want to understand how low-level network protocols work and their impact on your applications
- You think that security should be "by design"
- Your cloud bill is too bug and you want to take back control
- You are a developer and want to learn security
- You believe that the best defense is thinking like an attacker
- You learn by building and love to look under the hood
- You value simplicity and pragmatism
- You prefer getting things done over analysis paralysis

But I repeat, this book is NOT a computer science book.
